# Redis Benchmark Results

I have been exploring both DragonflyDB and Redis-Stack as options for in-memory datastores.

In this exploration I decided to run a few benchmarks in Go using the `github.com/redis/go-redis/v9` client.

All tests were performed on localhost behind Docker NAT, on a `AMD EPYC 7302P 16-Core Processor` inside a Proxmox VM with 24GB of allocated RAM available.

| Test         | Inserts | Value Size | Reads | Pipeline Size | redis-stack | dragonflydb |
|--------------|---------|------------|-------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| No-Pipeline  | 100k    | 5b         | 5m    | N/A           | 64.117s     | 66.052s     |
| No-Pipeline  | 100k    | 1kb        | 5m    | N/A           | 69.527s     | 70.019s     |
| No-Pipeline  | 100k    | 10kb       | 5m    | N/A           | 101.712s    | 90.429s     |
| Pipeline     | 500k    | 5b         | 25m   | 10k           | 16.583s     | 35.217s     |
| Pipeline     | 500k    | 1kb        | 25m   | 10k           | 42.633s     | 66.865s     |
| Pipeline     | 500k    | 1kb        | 25m   | 1k            | 39.503s     | 68.294s     |
| Pipeline     | 100k    | 10kb       | 5m    | 1k            | 49.189s     | 26.303s     |

From these results we can see that `redis-stack` handles pipelined reads with higher throughput than `dragonflydb`. The tests used pipelines with 10,000 commands in each to prevent I/O errors.

The `redis-stack` utilized 100% of its single CPU core during execution while the `dragonflydb` utilized around 45-60% of the 16 CPU cores assigned to the VM for the duration of the test.

Without Docker NAT, the `No-Pipeline` tests executed in half the time for both DBs, while the `Pipeline` test didn't have a noticable difference in execution time for either DB when running under `network=host`.

Redis recommends running `Redis Cluster` on a single host to shard out keys more effectively and increase throughput, I've yet to test that but given how little CPU utilization the single `redis-stack` consumed, I'm interested in conducting further testing.
